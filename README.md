## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using
  `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

I like to write first the HTML, only the HTML, it looks weird but when it's
done I have a better idea of the styles needed.

Then I try to use only CSS for everything (animations, states, styles) and the
last step is to add JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

1. How to group numbers.
2. How to use media queries with JS.
3. How to format numbers (Intl.NumberFormat).
   (This isn't effective for this particular project.)

### Continued development

- [ ] Update layout for horizontal orientation in mobile.
- [ ] Add other mathematical functions.

### Useful resources

[JS Media queries][1]
